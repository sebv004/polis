# polis
Run a Polis masternode with docker-compose.
## What it does
- Isolation of the app regarding your system
- Easy way to move a complete env
- It creates your polis.conf

## What it does not
- Set a firewall on your machine
- Set swap space and rules
- SSH stuff
- Update/Upgrade stuff (I should handle it for the next Polis release)
